# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 5th, 2019
##### Refactoring and Researching!

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my basic python To-Do List app to allow the json files to correctly save the data instead of wiping it after stopping the app. Refactored my duplicate email remover python app to use the replace method instead string concatenation. I also added a feature to the top of the app to create 100 random emails with varying name lengths, and selecting random ones from the list to comb through with the app to test its functionality. Lots of research and fideling with the code to get it to work, but it's so satisfying when it does!

**Thoughts:** I was able to fairly quickly fix what I messed up in the JSON import/export feature in my to-do list app, but the random function in python took me a while. I spent a good chunk of time researching how to properly use random.choice and random.randint well to fit my needs. Once I read enough and had a handle on it, it took some time to implement it in the right way to have it do what I wanted it to do. I'm happy with how it turned out, but I severely underestimated how long it was going to take! I feel happy about my day 1 :)
