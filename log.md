# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 5th, 2019
##### Refactoring and Researching!

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my basic python To-Do List app to allow the json files to correctly save the data instead of wiping it after stopping the app. Refactored my duplicate email remover python app to use the replace method instead string concatenation. I also added a feature to the top of the app to create 100 random emails with varying name lengths, and selecting random ones from the list to comb through with the app to test its functionality. Lots of research and fideling with the code to get it to work, but it's so satisfying when it does!

**Thoughts:** I was able to fairly quickly fix what I messed up in the JSON import/export feature in my to-do list app, but the random function in python took me a while. I spent a good chunk of time researching how to properly use random.choice and random.randint well to fit my needs. Once I read enough and had a handle on it, it took some time to implement it in the right way to have it do what I wanted it to do. I'm happy with how it turned out, but I severely underestimated how long it was going to take! I feel happy about my day 1 :)

### Day 2: July 6th, 2019
##### Researching and Raspberry

**Today's Progress**: Added an additional function to my basic python Pool Table Management App to email the data that was collected out to a manager/boss person. I spent many hours looking up how to do this, and I was extremely excited when I had it actually work in the app! Since I was able to get this done I had some time to be able to get started on my raspberry pi project, the google aiy voice kit. I loved constructing the hardware and putting it into the box, and booting it up. I'm learning so much just troubleshooting errors it's crazy!

**Thoughts:**: Taking on finding out how to add emails to the app was probably the longest I've researched to add functionality to a project so far, and it was easy to want to give up on it. I pushed through because I wasn't going to let research keep me from accomplishing my goal. When I was finally done with implementing it and it worked I literally screamed in excitement and ran around the house a bit. I called my wife and told her about how I was proud of it. This moment gave me the confidence to keep on tinkering and pushing because it makes the payoff afterwards that much better when you get it to work out!

### Day 3: July 7th, 2019
##### Voice Kit and Research

**Today's Progress**: Connected the Raspberry Pi to the Google API today and had the demos working! I've attached the Google Assistant API and the Cloud Speech-to Text API to be able to interact with the cube speaker! It's a lot of fun to play with, and I'm already thinking about how to manipulate the code to do some other projects with the foundation that this creates. I spent an hour listening to the audio book version of "The Complete Software Developer's Guide" by John Sonmez and I'm really enjoying his insight. He dives deep into a comprehensive outlook on what you need to do to push yourself down the path to being a successful software developer. The physical book is over 800 pages, so I'm going to be listening to it while driving for a while! Assignment 9 - Dev Tools Domination - JavaScript30 Challenge completed today! There were so many good tools that he covered in this video that I know I'm going to have to go back to it in the future. At the end of the day I began to work on a shopping list application in python and laid the framework for an app to utilize json to store the data. I made the application from scratch as a test to try and remember all of the things we've worked on at bootcamp up to this point.

**Thoughts:**: Today's efforts were shorter bursts than the last few days and didn't stress me out as much as the bigger goals. I didn't feel as exhilarated when I finished the tasks either, although I'm definitely showing off my Google Pi to everyone I see tomorrow! I'm in a good mental space, but I can definitely tell the strain that it's putting on my relationship with my social life. It's hard to balance going hard into leveling up my coding while still trying to spend time with friends and family. Overall it was a great day! I was able to handle doing a lot of chores, spending time with Ellie and getting enough done with code to be proud of it!

### Day 4: July 8th, 2019
##### Show and Tell and Networking

**Today's Progress**: I added the feature to the Voice Kit to boot up with the application running. I no longer need to plug in the externals, it can function as its own unique google home. I researched a bit about raspberry pi projects, and I've decided to go with a twitter bot! I'm just getting into twitter stuff, so I think it'll be a fun project :] I also did another JavaScript30 video today, and I was able to get more of the code! There are things that he's doing in JavaScript that work the same way as Python that I'm picking up on, and I was able to follow his logic step by step. I was super excited to come to that realization. I also attended a meetup today for freecodecamp, networked with Fitz and Nick, and had a good time talking with Jason this morning! It was a good good day building up and leveling up. The Coding Assignment for Bootcamp today was to build a website, so I'll link that git repo below!

**Thoughts:**: It's easier to stay motivated while at the bootcamp surrounded by fellow motivated people. This audiobook is really keeping me in the right frame of mind to really take my career to the next level! I'm getting into the blogging thing as well, which the news that Digital Crafts is going to feature it is amazing!! I'm really excited about growing and progressing and I can't help but be positive. Good day :]

### Day 5: July 9th, 2019
##### 

**Today's Progress**: I went through 2 JavaScript 30 videos, a Custom Video Player and Key Sequence Detection. I'm able to actually keep up and some of the shortcuts he's using I actually made connections with my knowledge base to know what was going on! I want to really study and master these shortcuts now, they're so cool! I'm still listening to the audiobook in the car, and I'm really excited about all of the information he is covering. I can tell that this will give me a leg up compared to other people in the industry that are in a similar boat. I attended the Amazon Web Services Meetup and it was way over my head. They dove into subject material that was in a related field, but it was pretty cutting edge and dense material. I wasn't the only one lost, but I was definitely the most lost. The format of the Meetup was incredible, held a high regard for everyone's time, had a great turnout, had eloquent speakers, and I'm definitely going to continue to attend the gathering. I'm linking the project from my github from Digital Crafts today as well.

**Thoughts:**: I'm definitely feeling the exhaustion of continuing to push myself to do more and more. I know I'm on Day 5 of this challenge, but my bootcamp is pushing us to do a lot of code and work in itself, so the extra stuff is really tough to continue to do. I think I'm going to start setting a schedule for myself ahead of time to allow my extra curriculars to get the time they need while being able to continue healthy fitness and eating habits. This is definitely a journey, but I'm very happy with it so far!
