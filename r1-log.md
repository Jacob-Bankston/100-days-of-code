## Log

### R1D1 
I made a To-Do List Application to practice JSON implementation a few days ago, and I updated it to allow the json file to correctly implement the stored data. I did an exercise in filtering an unfiltered email list, and sorting it a few days ago, and I added a feature to it today to generate a series of random emails with random additional spaces and line breaks. The code I had built previously was able to sort through the new list of the data and export it to a sorted file.
