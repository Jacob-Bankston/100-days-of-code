## Log

### R1D1 
I made a To-Do List Application to practice JSON implementation a few days ago, and I updated it to allow the json file to correctly implement the stored data. I did an exercise in filtering an unfiltered email list, and sorting it a few days ago, and I added a feature to it today to generate a series of random emails with random additional spaces and line breaks. The code I had built previously was able to sort through the new list of the data and export it to a sorted file.

### R1D2
I made a Pool Table Managment Application a few days ago, and I updated it with a feature to email the .txt file to someone utilizing yagmail. I had to figure out how to download pip3 onto my mac to be able to install yagmail, and I found one of the problems I've been having with installations since I purchased this mac! I'm excited to have an effective work around for that problem now! I worked on making my Google AIY Project - Voice Kit to play with the Google api voice functionality! I'm really excited about what to utilize with it.
