The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Friday, July 5th, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
I made a To-Do List Application to practice JSON implementation a few days ago, and I updated it to allow the json file to correctly implement the stored data. I did an exercise in filtering an unfiltered email list, and sorting it a few days ago, and I added a feature to it today to generate a series of random emails with random additional spaces and line breaks. The code I had built previously was able to sort through the new list of the data and export it to a sorted file.

### R1D2
I made a Pool Table Managment Application a few days ago, and I updated it with a feature to email the .txt file to someone utilizing yagmail. I had to figure out how to download pip3 onto my mac to be able to install yagmail, and I found one of the problems I've been having with installations since I purchased this mac! I'm excited to have an effective work around for that problem now! I worked on making my Google AIY Project - Voice Kit to play with the Google api voice functionality! I'm really excited about what to utilize with it.

### R1D3
I finished the Google AIY Voice Kit version 1.0 project, and have it working properly. I connected the Google Assistant and Google Speech-to-Text APIs to the pi to be able to run through the demos. I listened to an hour of "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide" audiobook by John Sonmez. I did challenge 9 of the JavaScript30 course by Wes Bos. The Dev Tools Domination video was short, but packed with great tools to use, that I know I'll go back to in the future. I created the framework for a shopping application in python to use a json file as a storage device for the information at the end of the day as well!

### R1D4
Added a feature to the Google Voice Kit to boot up with start up. Decided to make a Raspberry Pi Twitter Bot. Did #10 of JavaScript30 and understood every line of code! Listened to 2 hours of "The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide" audiobook by John Sonmez. Attended the freecodecamp Meetup and had some good conversations with people, even an alumni. Got featured by the DigitalCrafts Marketer for my first blog post! Created a Vanilla Website with HTML and CSS for the class assignment.

### R1D5
Went through the Video Player Creator and Key Sequence Creator videos on JavaScript 30, got into learning the shortcuts for javascript! Attended the Amazon Web Services Meetup and was thoroughly lost with the content, but loved the formatting of the meeting. Continued listening to the audiobook, it's going over resumes and tactics for applying. Good information!

### R1D6
Started and completed 13 videos in the 20 video series What the Flexbox. Listened to more of the audiobook. Finished the coding challenge for the day, and worked on my shortcut skills! Hopefully they'll begin to impact how quickly I can get my work done and navigate through the code.

### R1D7
Completed video 14 and 15 in the 20 video series What the Flexbox. Listened to more of the audiobook. Applied for the Twitter API to be able to create my Twitter bot, and researched the finishing steps for the bot. Reached out to a few people to get help with reframing my LinkedIn and my Resume! Finished the coding challenge for the day, and worked on my shortcut skills!

### R1D8
Completed videos 16 - 20 in video series What the Flexbox. Completed videos 1 - 7 in CSS Grid. Listened to more of the audiobook. Was accepted to the Twitter API. Researched heavily on what things to buy for future Raspberry Pi Kits. Worked on my shortcuts for the day at the end of the day.
